    add cycling masters
    implement manual tiling
    add support for workspace names
    implement config file reading and integrate

    ipc via separate client program
    builin scripting language
    config file in toml? lua? builtin scripting language?

conventions and rules
- pass windows around by their id
use the id to lookup windows, and instead pass references
to their storage structures
(allows you to mutably borrow windows within a single scope)

Dynamic tiling:
- Adding windows
    if no windows exist, make new window master
    follow master-slave example
- Removing windows
    remove window, then select new master from windows
    reconfigure window layout
