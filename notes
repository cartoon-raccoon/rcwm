conventions and rules
- pass windows around by their id
use the id to lookup windows, and instead pass references
to their storage structures
(allows you to mutably borrow windows within a single scope)

Dynamic tiling:
- Adding windows
    if no windows exist, make new window master
    follow master-slave example
- Removing windows
    remove window, then select new master from windows
    reconfigure window layout
